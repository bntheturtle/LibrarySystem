This program manages a categorized library of books. It can:

-Load books from a file, where each line contains a genre and the book's details (title, author, publication year).

-Parse and validate book data while handling formatting and potential errors safely.

-Automatically organize books by genre, storing them in memory using efficient data structures (Map and Set).

-Add new books to any genre, including creating a new genre if it doesn't exist.

-Display books by genre, including printing them in their original or sorted order (e.g., by title or author).

-Search for books by title, using case-insensitive partial matching.

-Save all books back to a file, preserving the structure and making sure newly added books are included.
